    'summary': 'When it comes down to it, all our data is just made of 1s and 0s. But data in the real world is obviously much more complex than that, so we impose extra meaning on top of it. We take it for granted that we can represent numbers, text and date/time information in our programs... indeed, these are three of the core building blocks which are used in just about every data model imaginable.\n\nSo how is it that it\'s all so broken? Why is Stack Overflow full of questions about arithmetic being "broken" because of using float or double? Is there any hope for things ever getting better?\n\nIn this talk, I\'ll give some examples of what\'s wrong with the world, allocate blame to just about everyone involved, and give a few suggestions to avoid getting burned. In all of this I\'ll be ably assisted by my friend, Tony the Pony',

    'summary': 'Wait... what? Are there any questions? Isn\'t that supposed to be at the end?\n\nNot this time. At NDC Oslo 2017, we\'re going to turn things upside-down and do the questions right at the beginning. Because, for as long as human beings have existed, we\'ve asked questions. Questions about the world around us. Questions about the past, about the future, about our place in the universe. As our world moves online, the search for answers has become inextricably linked with the history, and the future, of software development. The earliest mechanical calculating machines were built to answer questions - to solve complex mathematical problems many thousands of times faster than their human operators.\n\nToday, in the age of connected devices and machine learning, we live in a world where humans ask questions and expect computers to have the answers. So let\'s take this chance to ask some of the really big questions: Who are we? How did we get here? How is modern software changing the way we interact with the world around us? Where are the really big questions in modern software development - and who\'s working on them? And how will those questions shape the future of our relationship with the machines that have become such an important part of our lives?',
